<<Today did:>>
1.Navbar Links 
2.Navbar @media queries and functions for toggle navbar
3.Installed MaterislUi Icon npm in Navbar.js (here i mistakenly installed other 2 npm too, hopefully it will not affect the project)

<<Today Concerns:>>
Navbar created
But after clicking navbar when clicking on the togggle Button (after it appears when screen is small )
those hidden links will not dissapear when the screen is back on previous max size
.
Temp Solution : The problem is within the CSS media queries but I don't understand it.
                Study that!
<TODO/Learn: @media queries about HiddenLinks display (make it center)>
